# OpenPM

Welcome to the OpenPM repository, where OpenPM is hosted!

OpenPM runs on linux as a simple package grabber from custom DAF (Double Array Files)
package repositories. The program is built in Turbowarp, with the SB3 file attached.

## Getting Started

All you need to do is find a DAF URL to paste into the program, and it will do the
rest! You can find an online DAF repository, or make your own with the OpenDAF
program under my account.

## Notes

The project is technically open source, with the SB3 (Turbowarp only!) file attached.
Scratch coding is easy to understand, and you can edit this project as much as you
want, and no credit is needed (It would be nice if you did give credit though!). I
am not responsible for any packages that may harm your computer, as I do not have
control over what files are in the DAF repositories, and there is no malware
protection layer in the download process unless you have one installed.
